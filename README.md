# Project: Ohmmeter: Electrical Resistance Measurement Device

## Overview

The Ohmmeter is an electrical measuring device designed to measure the resistance of any resistor and display the result on an LCD screen. Whether you are working with small or large resistances, this device provides an accurate measurement, making it an essential tool for electronic hobbyists and professionals alike.

## Features

- Precise Measurement: Accurately measures resistance values in Ohms (Î©).
- LCD Display: Resistance values are displayed clearly on the LCD for easy reading.
- Easy-to-Use Interface: Simply connect a resistor, and the Ohmmeter will automatically measure and display the resistance.
- Compact Design: Designed to be portable and efficient for on-the-go use.


## Project Details
